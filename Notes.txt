~~~NOTES~~~~
1) Things we still need to accomplish
-- make the tiles "flash" to the beat of the music (see bpm's below)
-- find way to switch around the big tiles for increased difficulty
-- full database of music

2) fun things to add
-- below the game in the empty space have a "power bar" type thing, or
some sort of meter
-- would an animated background be asking for too much...?
-- randomly throughout gameplay have spontaneous words pop up
and fade out, based on the player's gameplay. i.e. "awesome!", "fantastic!"
or "boo!", "you can do better!"
-- improve the score display
-- for the player to have the ability to choose the genre of music and difficulty

~~~ OTHER NOTES ~~~~~~
My display code is pretty sloppy and excessive. I figured for now it's not a 
big deal, but later when we add other stuff we're going to want to minimize
the code so it would be best to start optimizing the display code

ABOUT STORYBOARD
Lua seems to run everything at once, not waiting for the previous thing to
finish, like Java. This will make "multithreading" easy but to get everything
to run in order (menu, animation, gameplay...) I used Corona's storyboard,
which is basically a way to control the flow of different "scenes" in the game.
It's pretty easy to use. Each script file can be a "scene" (or you can have
multiple scenes in one file) Just look at my code and you can figure it out
quickly.

^^or look at the docs^^

I think that that's everything. The code should all be well-commented so you
shouldn't have toooo much trouble following it.]
